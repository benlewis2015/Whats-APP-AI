# WhatsApp-Machine-Learning
This program reads a WhatsApp conversation txt file, and will attempt to coherently respond to user entered text based on statistics gained from the txt file.
This can be used with any properly formatted whatsApp text file obtained from the WhatsApp android application (untested with IOS).
Compile the program, save the .txt file in the same directory as the .exe file and run the program.

Issues
The text file uses unicode, output of " ' " and emojis doesn't alway look great.
