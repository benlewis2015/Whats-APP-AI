# WhatsApp-Machine-Learning

This program reads a WhatsApp conversation txt file, and will attempt to coherently respond to user entered text based on statistics gained from the txt file.
This can be used with any properly formatted whatsApp text file obtained from WhatsApp.
Compile the program using Visual Studio or GCC 6.2.0 (Makefile included, not tested on other versions of GCC, or with other flags not included in the Makefile).
For compiling with GCC using the Makefile run the command "make converse".
Save the .txt file in the same directory as the .exe (or .o if compiled with GCC) file and run the program.
